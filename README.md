# TrameApplication
Trame Application built for exascale modeling code impactX, which is part of the open-source Beam pLasma \& Accelerator Simulation Toolkit (BLAST). This application is aimed at better visualizing beam, plasma, and particle simulations. More about impactX here: https://impactx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

The application currently allows users to adjust accelerator parameters (beam charge/distribution, accelerator lattices) and analyze simulation results.

This project is created for my role as a Science Undergraduate Laboratory Intern (SULI) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) from (06/03/24 - 08/09/24).
